#Cinema-Cross#

In the September 2015 issue of GAMES Magazine there is a puzzle that challenges the reader to fill out a crossword puzzle using a word list, that will compose movie titles.

The key hints are the following:

- All films that go into the puzzle have Wiki pages
- "The first letter of each of the words in the orange boxes can be arranged to form a three-word movie title, which is the answer to the contest."

##Strategy##

The simplest strategy is to make a set of first-letters from the word list and then see what movies fit the constraints of being 17-letters in length and composed of 3-words.
